# Textile Note

**Why another notes app?**

- Simplicity. Textile Note is a single screen app that let's you take a note and save it to your device + have it delivered to your inbox with a single swipe.
- Privacy. We don't track anything about you except your email address for delivering your notes. We don't collect metrics outside those provided by iOS and Android app stores, and we don't plan to change that.
- Function. Your best ideas come whenever they want. Textile Note gives you the ability to capture those ideas without interupting your thoughts or conversations. Minimal and easy to use.
