# Textile Notes

**Why another notes app?**

- **Simplicity**. Textile Note is a single screen app that let's you take a note and save it to your device + have it delivered to your inbox with a single swipe.
- **Privacy**. We don't track anything about you except your email address for delivering your notes. We don't collect metrics outside those provided by iOS and Android app stores, and we don't plan to change that.
- **Function**. Your best ideas come whenever they want. Textile Note gives you the ability to capture those ideas without interupting your thoughts or conversations. Minimal and easy to use.

## Running Textile Inside

Textile Note stores notes on device using a local IPFS node, later we'll use that node to help you sync your notes across devices. The app uses the [Textile React Native SDK](https://github.com/textileio/react-native-sdk) to manage note encryption and pinning locally. 

## Built with Textile Boilerplate

If you want to build your own app, feel free to pick this code apart or just grab the [advanced boilerplate](https://github.com/textileio/advanced-react-native-boilerplate) we used.
